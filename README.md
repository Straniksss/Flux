## 🚀 About Flux Tasks

**Flux Tasks** is a premium, offline-first project management application designed specifically for developers, creators, and teams who value speed, privacy, and rich aesthetics. 

Unlike traditional project management tools, Flux Tasks stores **100% of your data locally** on your machine. No cloud databases, no tracking, no mandatory subscriptions. Just pure, instant desktop performance wrapped in a gorgeous liquid-glass user interface.

Additionally, Flux Tasks features an **optional GitHub integration** using a streamlined Personal Access Token (PAT) flow. Link your local projects to GitHub repositories, track remote releases, and sync issues—all while retaining the ability to work entirely offline.

---

## 🔌 GitHub & Offline-First Flexibility

Flux Tasks is architected from the ground up to place full ownership of data in your hands. You don't need a GitHub account, a token, or even an active internet connection to use the core system.

### 🛡️ 100% Offline Mode (No GitHub Connected)
When used entirely offline or without a linked GitHub account, all features remain fully functional:
* **Local Projects & Roadmaps**: Create and manage local projects and milestones without any network requests.
* **Smart Tasks & Checklists**: Create bugs, features, refactors, docs, or AI prompts stored directly in your local SQLite database.
* **Local Code Snippets**: Save and edit code fragments with syntax highlighting.
* **Local Attachments**: Import and open project resources (images, PDFs, ZIP archives) locally.
* **Local Backups & Exports**: Export data to Markdown, JSON, HTML, or CSV, and create/restore local database backups.

### 🐙 Optional GitHub Integration (When Connected)
If you decide to link a project to a GitHub repository, you get access to advanced repository metrics:
* **Repository Dashboard**: View stars, forks, open issues, PR counts, default branch, and last push date directly in the app.
* **Issues Integration**: Synchronize states, import GitHub issues into local tasks, or automatically create GitHub issues from your tasks.
* **Local Git Actions**: Perform `commit`, `pull`, `push`, and `tag` commands, or launch a terminal directly in your project folder.
* **Release Timeline Viewer**: Render a read-only timeline of your repository's GitHub Releases history.
* **High-Level Security**: Your Personal Access Token (PAT) is never stored in plain text or shared with the renderer; it is securely encrypted using Electron's `safeStorage` API and stays safely inside your local SQLite DB.

---

## 🐙 Detailed GitHub & Git Integration Points

For developers looking to understand where and how Git and GitHub are integrated across the Flux Tasks codebase, here is a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Connection & Token Security (`electron/git-github.ts`)
* **Settings Panel Integration (`src/components/GitHubSettings.tsx`)**: Prompts the user to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) via a pre-filled GitHub scopes link, connects the account, and displays profile details (username, avatar, scopes, list of repositories).
* **Electron safeStorage Encryption**: When the user connects their GitHub account, the PAT is transferred to the main process, encrypted using OS-level keychains via Electron's `safeStorage` API, and saved as a hexadecimal string in the local SQLite settings table.
* **Security Isolation**: The decrypted token is **never** sent back to the frontend renderer or logged, completely protecting it from cross-site scripting (XSS) extraction.

### 2. Repository Dashboard (`src/components/GitHubProjectDashboard.tsx`)
* **Dashboard Tab**: Renders repository metadata fetched via the GitHub REST API, showing:
  * Open issues count (excluding Pull Requests) and Pull Requests count.
  * Stars and forks counters.
  * Repository default branch and the last push timestamp.
  * A shortcut to open the remote repository in the default web browser.

### 3. Issues Sync & Management
* **Issues Tab (`src/components/GitHubProjectDashboard.tsx`)**:
  * **Import Issue**: Resolves issue fields and saves them as a local SQLite task, including labels, description, and status mappings.
  * **Link Issue**: Links an existing local task to a GitHub issue.
* **Task Details View (`src/components/TaskDetailView.tsx`)**:
  * **Linked Issue Card**: Displays the state of the linked issue (open or closed) dynamically in the task properties sidebar.
  * **Create Issue**: Automatically converts task descriptions, tags, and checklist items to markdown and posts it to GitHub to create a remote issue.

### 4. Local Git Command execution (`electron/git-github.ts` $\rightarrow$ CLI Spawn)
* **Local Path Configuration**: By specifying a local folder path in the project editor, the following operations are enabled:
  * **Git Status**: Parses unstaged, staged, and untracked files using `git status --porcelain`.
  * **Commit**: Runs `git add -A` and `git commit -m "[message]"` on your files.
  * **Tag**: Spawns annotated tags using `git tag [name] -m "[message]"`.
  * **Pull & Push**: Syncs code with the remote repository origin (`git pull`/`git push`).
  * **Terminal/Folder Launchers**: Spawns PowerShell inside the project directory, or opens it inside the default system File Explorer.

### 5. Read-Only Releases Timeline (`src/components/GitHubReleasesView.tsx`)
* **Roadmap Viewer Tab**: Placed inside the roadmap switcher to render version history, release notes, release tags, release states (`Draft`, `Prerelease`, `Latest Stable`), and lists of download assets along with their file sizes and download counts.
* **Strict Read-Only Access**: All mutation controls (creating releases, editing notes, deleting tags, or uploading binaries) are fully removed from the user interface.

### 6. Command-Line Release Pipeline (`scripts/release.js`)
* **Decoupled System**: Compiling application packages and publishing update manifests (`latest.json` or `latest-[channel].json`) is restricted to the Node CLI script.
* **Authentication**: Uses `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN` or a token configured inside the local `.env` configuration file.
* **Process**: Compiles files, builds setup installers and portable ZIPs, generates update hashes, and automates creating tags and uploading the assets to GitHub Releases.

## 🛠️ Development & Build Guide

If you are developing or building Flux Tasks locally, follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or newer)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named `.env` in the root folder of the project, and add the following keys:
```env
# GitHub token for release publishing (repo, read:user, workflow scopes)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here

# GitHub repository owner and repository name
GITHUB_OWNER=Straniksss
GITHUB_REPO=Flux-Tasks

# URL to poll for client-side OTA auto-update checks
UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL=https://github.com/Straniksss/Flux-Tasks/releases/latest/download/latest.json
```

### 3. Run Locally in Dev Mode
1. Install node packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the hot-reloading dev environment:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *This starts the local Vite server and boots the Electron application frame.*

### 4. Build Standalone Installer Locally
To compile frontend code and build the final executable installer:
```bash
npm run build
```
*This produces standalone installers and portable ZIP packages inside the `release/` directory.*

## 🚀 Automated Releases & OTA

Flux Tasks features a custom-built automation pipeline for compiling, verifying, and publishing updates.

### Release Script (`npm run release`)
Running `npm run release` prompts you for release metadata:
1. **Target Version**: (e.g., `1.1.15`, `1.2.0-beta.1`)
2. **Release Channel**: (`stable`, `beta`, `alpha`, `rc`)
3. **Release Title**: Heading for the changelog
4. **Changelog Notes**: Bullet points representing changes
5. **GitHub Repository**: Target owner/repo (defaults to the setting in `.env` or `Straniksss/Flux-Tasks`)

#### What the script does under the hood:
* Stops active `Flux Tasks.exe` instances to prevent locking files.
* Bumps target version, automatically stages all changed project files, commits them, and pushes them to your current remote Git branch (`git push origin [branch]`).
* Builds the React client and compiles Electron main/preload processes via `esbuild`.
* Bundles files into an `app.asar` archive and validates structure.
* Calculates SHA256 checksums and file sizes.
* Generates OTA (Over-the-Air) update manifests:
  * Stable releases publish/overwrite `latest.json` and `latest-stable.json`.
  * Pre-releases (beta, alpha, rc) write to isolated manifests (e.g., `latest-beta.json`).
* If a `GITHUB_TOKEN` is found, automatically creates a GitHub Release, tags the repository, cleans up duplicate assets, and uploads the manifest files, `app.asar`, portable ZIP, and NSIS setup installer.

---

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

* **Zero Tracking**: No telemetry, no usage analytics, and no external tracking pixels.
* **Offline-First Storage**: The app behaves 100% identically when you are disconnected from the network.
* **Secure Token Handling**: When using the optional GitHub integration:
  * Personal Access Tokens are encrypted using Electron's OS-level credentials system (`safeStorage`).
  * Tokens are never stored plain-text, never logged to stdout/files, and never sent to the renderer process.
  * All GitHub requests are routed through Electron's main process for advanced header security.
