## 🚀 About Flux Tasks

**Flux Tasks** is a premium, offline-first project management application designed specifically for developers, creators, and teams who value speed, privacy, and rich aesthetics. 

Unlike traditional project management tools, Flux Tasks stores **100% of your data locally** on your machine. No cloud databases, no tracking, no mandatory subscriptions. Just pure, instant desktop performance wrapped in a gorgeous liquid-glass user interface.

Additionally, Flux Tasks features an **optional GitHub integration** using a streamlined Personal Access Token (PAT) flow. Link your local projects to GitHub repositories, track remote releases, and sync issues—all while retaining the ability to work entirely offline.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📋 Smart Task Management
Create and organize multi-type tasks optimized for development cycles:
* 🐞 **Bugs**: Document, track, and squash code issues.

* 🚀 **Releases**: Group tasks under specific project versions.
* 🔧 **Refactors**: Keep your codebase clean and structured.
* 📝 **Documentation**: Draft guidelines and design specs right alongside your code.
* 🤖 **AI Prompts**: Store, tag, and refine prompts for ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

### 🎨 Liquid-Glass Interface
Enjoy an interactive experience inspired by **Apple visionOS**, **Arc Browser**, and **Linear**:
* **Aero Glass & Acrylic Blur**: Beautiful backdrop filters that blend with your desktop environment.
* **Dynamic HSL Gradients**: Curated color palettes with smooth interactive states.
* **Micro-Animations**: Fluid transitions powered by Framer Motion.
* **Typographic Harmony**: Structured typography with premium system font fallbacks.

### 🛣 Timeline & Roadmaps
Plan and visualize your development trajectory:
* Track versions, milestones, and release goals.
* **Release Timeline Switcher**: Instantly switch between checking local SQLite milestones and pulling GitHub releases in real time.

### 📦 Optional GitHub Integration
* **Simplified Authorization**: Connect via a single click using a pre-configured PAT creation link (`repo`, `read:user`, `workflow` scopes).
* **Robust Encryption**: Your PAT is never stored in plain text or exposed to the renderer; it is securely encrypted using Electron's `safeStorage` API before saving to your SQLite database.
* **Issue Linking & Status Cards**: Map checklist items to markdown syntax and easily monitor linked GitHub issues.

### 💻 Local Code Snippets & Attachments
* Keep your code fragments and snippets organized with integrated syntax highlighting for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Bash, and PowerShell.
* Attach PDFs, logs, images, and ZIP files directly to your projects.

### 🔍 Instant Global Search
* Instantly search across all tasks, descriptions, code snippets, notes, and AI prompts with zero network latency.

## 💾 Local Storage Architecture

All data resides safely on your disk. You own your files:

```text
%APPDATA%/Flux Tasks/   (Windows)
~/Library/Application Support/Flux Tasks/ (macOS)
~/.config/Flux Tasks/   (Linux)

├── tasks.db         # Core SQLite database containing tasks, projects, snippets, and encrypted credentials
├── backups/         # Auto-generated database checkpoints and backups
└── exports/         # Markdown, JSON, and CSV project exports
```

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or newer)
* npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Straniksss/Flux-Tasks.git
   cd Flux-Tasks
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

## 💻 Development Workflow

To run and build Flux Tasks in your local environment, use the following commands:

* **Start Development Mode**:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  *Launches the Vite dev server and opens the Electron app shell concurrently with hot-reloading.*

* **Type-Check Code**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

* **Compile Assets**:
  * Build the React frontend: `npm run build:frontend`
  * Bundle Electron processes: `npm run build:electron`

* **Produce Installers (Windows)**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  *Creates standalone NSIS Installers (`.exe`) and portable ZIP archives in the `release/` folder.*

## 🚀 Automated Releases & OTA

Flux Tasks features a custom-built automation pipeline for compiling, verifying, and publishing updates.

### Release Script (`npm run release`)
Running `npm run release` prompts you for release metadata:
1. **Target Version**: (e.g., `1.1.15`, `1.2.0-beta.1`)
2. **Release Channel**: (`stable`, `beta`, `alpha`, `rc`)
3. **Release Title**: Heading for the changelog
4. **Changelog Notes**: Bullet points representing changes
5. **GitHub Repository**: Target owner/repo (defaults to the setting in `.env` or `Straniksss/Flux-Tasks`)

#### What the script does under the hood:
* Stops active `Flux Tasks.exe` instances to prevent locking files.
* Builds the React client and compiles Electron main/preload processes via `esbuild`.
* Bundles files into an `app.asar` archive and validates structure.
* Calculates SHA256 checksums and file sizes.
* Generates OTA (Over-the-Air) update manifests:
  * Stable releases publish/overwrite `latest.json` and `latest-stable.json`.
  * Pre-releases (beta, alpha, rc) write to isolated manifests (e.g., `latest-beta.json`).
* If a `GITHUB_TOKEN` is found, automatically creates a GitHub Release, tags the repository, cleans up duplicate assets, and uploads the manifest files, `app.asar`, portable ZIP, and NSIS setup installer.

---

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

* **Zero Tracking**: No telemetry, no usage analytics, and no external tracking pixels.
* **Offline-First Storage**: The app behaves 100% identically when you are disconnected from the network.
* **Secure Token Handling**: When using the optional GitHub integration:
  * Personal Access Tokens are encrypted using Electron's OS-level credentials system (`safeStorage`).
  * Tokens are never stored plain-text, never logged to stdout/files, and never sent to the renderer process.
  * All GitHub requests are routed through Electron's main process for advanced header security.
