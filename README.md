## 🚀 About Flux Tasks

**Flux Tasks** is a premium, offline-first project management application designed specifically for developers, creators, and teams who value speed, privacy, and rich aesthetics. 

Unlike traditional project management tools, Flux Tasks stores **100% of your data locally** on your machine. No cloud databases, no tracking, no mandatory subscriptions. Just pure, instant desktop performance wrapped in a gorgeous liquid-glass user interface.

Additionally, Flux Tasks features an **optional GitHub integration** using a streamlined Personal Access Token (PAT) flow. Link your local projects to GitHub repositories, track remote releases, and sync issues—all while retaining the ability to work entirely offline.

---

## 🔌 GitHub & Offline-First Flexibility

Flux Tasks is architected from the ground up to place full ownership of data in your hands. You don't need a GitHub account, a token, or even an active internet connection to use the core system.

### 🛡️ 100% Offline Mode (No GitHub Connected)
When used entirely offline or without a linked GitHub account, all features remain fully functional:
* **Local Projects & Roadmaps**: Create and manage local projects and milestones without any network requests.
* **Smart Tasks & Checklists**: Create bugs, features, refactors, docs, or AI prompts stored directly in your local SQLite database.
* **Local Code Snippets**: Save and edit code fragments with syntax highlighting.
* **Local Attachments**: Import and open project resources (images, PDFs, ZIP archives) locally.
* **Local Backups & Exports**: Export data to Markdown, JSON, HTML, or CSV, and create/restore local database backups.

### 🐙 Optional GitHub Integration (When Connected)
If you decide to link a project to a GitHub repository, you get access to advanced repository metrics:
* **Repository Dashboard**: View stars, forks, open issues, PR counts, default branch, and last push date directly in the app.
* **Issues Integration**: Synchronize states, import GitHub issues into local tasks, or automatically create GitHub issues from your tasks.
* **Local Git Actions**: Perform `commit`, `pull`, `push`, and `tag` commands, or launch a terminal directly in your project folder.
* **Release Timeline Viewer**: Render a read-only timeline of your repository's GitHub Releases history.
* **High-Level Security**: Your Personal Access Token (PAT) is never stored in plain text or shared with the renderer; it is securely encrypted using Electron's `safeStorage` API and stays safely inside your local SQLite DB.

## 💾 Local Storage Architecture

All data resides safely on your disk. You own your files:

```text
%APPDATA%/Flux Tasks/   (Windows)
~/Library/Application Support/Flux Tasks/ (macOS)
~/.config/Flux Tasks/   (Linux)

├── tasks.db         # Core SQLite database containing tasks, projects, snippets, and encrypted credentials
├── backups/         # Auto-generated database checkpoints and backups
└── exports/         # Markdown, JSON, and CSV project exports
```

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Installing Flux Tasks is quick and simple.

1. **Download the Web Installer**:
   Download the installer package directly: [Flux Tasks Web Setup (EXE)](https://github.com/Straniksss/Flux-Tasks/releases/download/installer-v1/Flux.Tasks.Web.Setup.exe)
2. **Run Setup**:
   Launch `Flux.Tasks.Web.Setup.exe` on your system. The installer will set up all dependencies and prepare the application shell.
3. **Start Organizing**:
   Open the app from your Desktop or Start Menu and begin managing your projects offline!

## 🚀 Automated Releases & OTA

Flux Tasks features a custom-built automation pipeline for compiling, verifying, and publishing updates.

### Release Script (`npm run release`)
Running `npm run release` prompts you for release metadata:
1. **Target Version**: (e.g., `1.1.15`, `1.2.0-beta.1`)
2. **Release Channel**: (`stable`, `beta`, `alpha`, `rc`)
3. **Release Title**: Heading for the changelog
4. **Changelog Notes**: Bullet points representing changes
5. **GitHub Repository**: Target owner/repo (defaults to the setting in `.env` or `Straniksss/Flux-Tasks`)

#### What the script does under the hood:
* Stops active `Flux Tasks.exe` instances to prevent locking files.
* Builds the React client and compiles Electron main/preload processes via `esbuild`.
* Bundles files into an `app.asar` archive and validates structure.
* Calculates SHA256 checksums and file sizes.
* Generates OTA (Over-the-Air) update manifests:
  * Stable releases publish/overwrite `latest.json` and `latest-stable.json`.
  * Pre-releases (beta, alpha, rc) write to isolated manifests (e.g., `latest-beta.json`).
* If a `GITHUB_TOKEN` is found, automatically creates a GitHub Release, tags the repository, cleans up duplicate assets, and uploads the manifest files, `app.asar`, portable ZIP, and NSIS setup installer.

---

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

* **Zero Tracking**: No telemetry, no usage analytics, and no external tracking pixels.
* **Offline-First Storage**: The app behaves 100% identically when you are disconnected from the network.
* **Secure Token Handling**: When using the optional GitHub integration:
  * Personal Access Tokens are encrypted using Electron's OS-level credentials system (`safeStorage`).
  * Tokens are never stored plain-text, never logged to stdout/files, and never sent to the renderer process.
  * All GitHub requests are routed through Electron's main process for advanced header security.
